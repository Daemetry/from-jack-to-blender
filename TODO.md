# The list of things we''l most probably have to do:

0. The sine and cosine functions to describe rotations - DONE!
1. The fraction class - DONE!
1*. There is a slight possibility we'll need more than just fractions,
or simply more space in the int values, this might require us 
to realise some kind of bigger int, at least int32, mb

3. and 4. The point class and the vector class - DONE! in one

5. The camera class
6. The 3D-figure class - DONE!
7. A way to store and display render data - DONE!

Hurray, everything's working! Well, not "everything", but for most part...
